# Research: `sidebars.js` Generation for Docusaurus

**Decision**: We will use a custom script to generate `sidebars.js` based on the module directory structure.

**Rationale**:
- Docusaurus's autogenerated sidebars are based on alphabetical order of files, which may not match the desired "correct module order".
- A custom script provides full control over the sidebar structure, ensuring the modules appear in the intended sequence.
- This approach is more robust and scalable than manually maintaining `sidebars.js` as modules are added or reordered.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Manual `sidebars.js`**: Rejected because it's error-prone and doesn't scale well.
- **Docusaurus `autogenerated` with file naming conventions (e.g., `01-module1`, `02-module2`)**: Considered but rejected as it makes file names less readable and still relies on a convention that could be broken. A script provides a single source of truth for the sidebar logic.

**Implementation Details**:
- The script will be written in JavaScript and placed in a `scripts/` directory.
- It will read the `docs/` directory to get the list of modules.
- It will use a configuration file (e.g., `module-order.json`) to define the correct order of modules.
- The script will generate the `sidebars.js` file with the correct structure and order.
